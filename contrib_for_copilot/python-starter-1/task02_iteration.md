# Task 02: Iteration

**Goal:** Learn how to use loops and get user input

## Overview

In this task, you'll learn:

- How to use `for` loops
- How to use the `range()` function
- How to get user input with `input()`

## Task 02a (Required)

Open `task02_iteration.py` and edit the file to do the following tasks.

The function `show_one_to_ten()` currently shows numbers from 0 to 5, which is incorrect.

Correct the function so that the numbers from 1 to 10 are displayed.

The `range()` function has the syntax:

```python
range(start, stop)  # Generates numbers from start to stop-1
```

For example:

- `range(0, 5)` gives: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- `range(1, 6)` gives: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

To get numbers 1 to 10, you need:

```python
range(1, 11)  # 11 because stop is exclusive (excluded)
```

</details>

## Task 02b (Required)

Complete the function `show_one_to_n()` so that it:

1. First asks the user to enter a number `n`
2. Then displays numbers from 1 to `n`

Use the `input()` function to get user input:

```python
user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
```

⚠️ **Important:** `input()` returns a string, so you need to convert it to an integer!

```python
n = int(user_input)
```

</details>

You can combine input and conversion in one line:

```python
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
```

</details>

## Task 02c (Optional)

Add a function `show_one_to_n_ordinal()`, which is the same as `show_one_to_n()` but displays the numbers as ordinal numbers.

Namely, the output should be:

```console
Enter a number: 4
1st
2nd
3rd
4th
```

<details>
<summary>Click to see hint</summary>

You need to add suffixes based on the number:

- Most numbers: add "th" (4th, 5th, 6th, ...)
- Numbers ending in 1: add "st" (1st, 21st, 31st, ...)
- Numbers ending in 2: add "nd" (2nd, 22nd, 32nd, ...)
- Numbers ending in 3: add "rd" (3rd, 23rd, 33rd, ...)
- **Special cases:** 11th, 12th, 13th (not 11st, 12nd, 13rd!)

You can use `if-elif-else` statements and the modulo operator `%` to check the last digit.

## Understanding Loops

### The `for` loop syntax

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # code to repeat
```

### The `range()` function

```python
range(5)        # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
range(1, 6)     # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
range(0, 10, 2) # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

for i in range(-1, 5):
   print(i)
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting to convert input to integer**
   - ❌ `n = input("Enter: ")` then using `n` in `range()`
   - ✅ `n = int(input("Enter: "))`

2. **Wrong range boundaries**
   - ❌ `range(1, 10)` for numbers 1 to 10 (gives 1 to 9)
   - ✅ `range(1, 11)` for numbers 1 to 10

3. **Forgetting the colon** after the `for` statement
   - ❌ `for i in range(10)`
   - ✅ `for i in range(10):`

- Review Python loop syntax
- Test with small numbers first
- Use `print()` to debug
